                    <predicate>

                        <!--
							Each include can also exclude specific subitems by path:
							<exclude path="/sitecore/content"/>

							Excludes may also exclude all children at once by adding a trailing slash, e.g. this would include the root /sitecore item but no children
							<include path="/sitecore">
								<exclude path="/sitecore/" />
							</include>

							NOTE: after changing what is included or excluded, you should reserialize all items, or at least the added items
							NOTE: the "name" attribute controls the folder name the items will go into (for SFS). If unspecified, the last path segment is used. Names must be unique across the configuration.
